## Overview

Material-UI, often abbreviated as MUI, provides a powerful set of user interface components for React applications. This project demonstrates the usage of two core components:

- **Accordion**: The Material-UI Accordion component offers a collapsible section that allows users to expand and collapse content with ease.

- **Switch**: The Material-UI Switch component serves as a toggle switch that controls the state of the collapsible section. When the switch is toggled, it dynamically updates the content's visibility and style.

By leveraging the `useState` hook, we achieve dynamic state management, enabling the content to respond to user interactions and re-render as needed.

## Features

- Utilizes Material-UI's Accordion and Switch components.
- Implements dynamic content expansion and collapse based on the Switch state.
- Provides a clear example for understanding how to use these components in a React application.
